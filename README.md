The motivation for this assignment is to create a website to house my programming work as well as display my skills in html and css through the lay out of the website.
It was an exercise in cementing my skills in both of these programming languages and showing me I still have a long way to go. 
This website will allow interested parties to view previous work of mine and also to show off a bit of my style when it comes to stylesheets.
I learned that it is hard to make a website look good and that I am not going to be able to make it beautiful instantly; a lot more work goes in to that than I expected.
Some elements I implemented for the first time were flex boxes, images, hover functions and colours. 
The major take away from this project is that I have a whole bunch of work ahead of me, but it is going to be very rewarding when some of these semantics start sticking in my head.
